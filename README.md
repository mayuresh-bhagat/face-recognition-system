# Face Recognition System

This is a Python-based Face Recognition System designed to identify and verify individuals from images. The system uses deep learning models, specifically **Siamese Neural Networks** for one-shot learning, and can be extended to work with various facial recognition tasks.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detect faces from images using OpenCV and pre-trained models.
- **Face Recognition**: Use a pre-trained deep learning model to recognize faces.
- **Face Verification**: Verify whether two images belong to the same person using Siamese Networks.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Real-time face recognition from webcam feeds.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** for deep learning
- **OpenCV** for computer vision tasks
- **Keras** for building neural networks
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning tasks
- **Kotlin** for android application
